# api-testing-dotnet

Hey,

It's a simple project for API Testing with C# with Xunit, HttpClient, FluentAssertions and FluentObjetcs. </br>
First of all, you have downloading/clone this project for your PC and to install all dependencies. Okay?

Do you have dotnet installed? If not, you can know how to install in this link: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/</br>
It simplify your life for installing all dependencies with dotnet command line or inside the Visual Studio, as we want!

# How to build

* git clone https://github.com/nathsilv/api-testing-dotnet.git </br>
* dotnet build

# How to run the tests?

First, up your API server(In my **api-node** project in my Github I show how to up the server if you don't know it)</br>
Then, in the project directory execute: </br>
``` dotnet test``` </br></br>

Simple, Isn't It?</br>
